QUESTION: Replay Formats?
02/12/14, 7:08 PM - Siri: What are the different Replay Formats?!
02/12/14, 7:08 PM - Ashwin: Oh thats just to control at what speed you see your messages
02/12/14, 7:08 PM - Ashwin: Auto - Plays each message at a constant interval

Random - As the name suggests plays each message at a random interval

Time Based - This looks at the time the message was sent and tries to replicate its effect, sped up at different rates depending in the difference (Trust me, you do not want to wait a day for the message)

Word Based - The size of the message determines the interval (Longer messages stay on for longer). Best for reading the conversation without pausing

All At Once - Well some of just cant wait, so show ALL AT ONCE!

Tools > Create Shortcut) or any other browser.
